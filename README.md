# Flappy Bird Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to replicate the core gameplay experience of the original game, where players control a bird navigating through a series of pipes, aiming to achieve the highest possible score.

## Objectives
- To create an engaging and interactive game using web technologies.
- To demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- To understand and implement basic game development concepts like game loops, collision detection, and user input handling.
- To provide a fun and challenging experience for players.

## How It Works
- **Gameplay**: Players control a bird that moves continuously forward. The bird is affected by gravity and falls unless the player clicks or taps, which makes the bird flap and rise.
- **Obstacles**: Pipes with varying gaps come from the right side of the screen, and the player must navigate the bird through these gaps.
- **Scoring**: Each pair of pipes passed scores one point. The game keeps track of the player's score.
- **End Game**: The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground. Players can then restart the game.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the game's canvas and UI elements.
- **CSS**: Employed to style the game's visuals, including custom styles for the bird, pipes, background, and score display.
- **JavaScript**: The core technology used for implementing game mechanics, controls, physics, collision detection, and the scoring system.

## Running the Game
- Clone/download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
